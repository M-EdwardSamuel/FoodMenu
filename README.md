# Food Menu Web Application

This is a responsive food menu web application built using ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core. It allows users to browse a variety of dishes, view detailed ingredients, and search for specific food items. The app uses a SQL Server database hosted locally via SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

## Application Structure

### Models
- `Dish`: Represents a food item with name, price, and image
- `Ingredient`: Represents an ingredient used in a dish
- `DishIngredient`: Junction table to model the many-to-many relationship

### Data Context
- `MenuContext.cs`: Inherits from `DbContext` and configures entity relationships and seed data using Fluent API

### Controllers
- `FoodMenuController.cs`:
  - `Index`: Displays all dishes; includes search by dish name
  - `Details`: Shows dish details and its list of ingredients

### Views
- Strongly typed Razor views for listing dishes, showing details, and handling search input

## Database Configuration

The database is configured in `appsettings.json` or `Startup.cs` (depending on the version of ASP.NET Core). Here's a typical connection string:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=FoodMenuDB;Trusted_Connection=True;"
}
```

Run the following commands in the **Package Manager Console** to set up the database:

```bash
Add-Migration InitialCreate
Update-Database
```
